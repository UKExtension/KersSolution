<p><strong>I. COUNTY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN</strong></p>



<p>

The Kentucky Cooperative Extension System is committed to ensuring that its programs and employment opportunities are available to all citizens without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability.  This commitment includes involving citizens in the determination of programs, program content and in the implementation of these programs.

</p>

<p>

The County Affirmative Action Plan serves as a guide for actions in programming and insuring equal opportunities.  The plan is based on the principle of ensuring balanced participation in the system’s planning structure, program delivery actions, and ultimately in program participation.  It is the responsibility of each Cooperative Extension staff member to implement All Reasonable Efforts necessary to attain the goals of inclusionary membership in advisory groups and participation in programs. Agents and advisory councils must consider the needs of underserved and under-represented groups - that is, those groups who have not been participating in program opportunities.

</p>

<p>

The County Affirmative Action Plan will be written for a 4 year period of time which coincides with the County Plan of Work and will be updated annually to reflect changes in the community and the level of success in achieving the goals of the previous year’s plan.  It is suggested that each county use a committee of their Extension Council to annually review operations of the county program to identify underserved audiences, programming needs for those audiences, and successes in programming for targeted audiences by looking at the total county Extension program as a whole.

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>II. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE COUNTY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN</strong></p>

<p>The County Affirmative Action Plan will include: </p>

<p>

</p><ol>

<li> A description of the county situation as it affects programming.</li>



<li>A listing of the current makeup of the County Extension Council, District Board and Program Councils by race and gender.</li>



<li> Affirmative action goals – identified outcomes which will illustrate progress toward balanced participation in extension programs.</li>

<li> Action strategies planned to reach these goals </li>

<li> An annual accounting of efforts and successes in reaching the identified goals.</li>

</ol>

<p></p>



<p><strong><u>Situational Statement</u></strong> - The county plan should include a description and characteristics of the county reflecting diversity in demographics, program audiences, available resources, and the county program.  This statement should describe the current state of affairs yet expose the areas where improvement is needed.  Some of the components of the situational statement might be:

</p><ul>

<li> the racial composition of the county</li>

<li> the identification of special target audiences</li>

<li> a listing and the composition of advisory groups and programming committees</li>

<li> a listing of groups and organizations Extension works with to reach targeted audiences</li>

<li> most recent program contact numbers showing racial, gender, number or percentage of adults reached and how that compares to parity of participation.</li>



<li>You must complete the chart on Councils and District Board makeup by race and gender.</li>



</ul>

The best available data will be used to determine the demographic composition of the population and to define potential audiences.

<p></p>



<p><strong><u>Affirmative Action Goals</u> -</strong> This is the state of affairs county programs are working toward in terms of reaching all audiences.  The affirmative action goals are proactive (affirmative) actions planned to ensure broad participation by county residents.  These goals will come about as a result of examining the makeup of advisory committees, geographic, age, racial and gender participation in programs, and the variety of programming opportunities provided to extension audiences.<br><br>

<strong>Examples of Goal Statements:</strong>

</p><ul>

<li> Improve geographic representation on councils.</li>

<li> Increase teen involvement in 4-H programs.</li>

<li> Increase the number of minorities serving on councils.</li>

<li> Increase minorities serving in leadership roles.</li>

<li> Increase incentives for limited resource and minority youth to participate in youth development activities through increased publicity, grants and/or scholarships.</li>

<li> Increase assistance from volunteers in recruiting council members and attracting clientele to programs from diverse populations.</li>

<li> Promote extension programs and activities among people in underserved regions of the county.</li>

<li> Increase the number of minority farmers participating in programs where they can qualify to receive cost share funds through Phase 1 Programs.</li>

<li> Program participation will reflect the diversity of the community (parity).</li>

<li> Increase the number of women in agricultural leadership roles.</li>

<li> Increase youth programming in the Amish community.</li>

</ul>

<p></p>



<p><strong><u>Specific action strategies to accomplish identified Affirmative Action Goals</u> -</strong> Action strategies should be as specific as possible and should include those efforts the county staff intends to initiate during this program year.  Many of these efforts will be related to strengthening councils and leadership and providing more diversity in these groups.  Actual programming efforts should be planned and deliberate and so <strong>excerpts from the county Plan of Work may be provided as evidence that planned programs will include audiences identified as underserved and targeted as program recipients.</strong>

</p>



<p><strong><u>Examples of Action Strategies:</u></strong>

</p><ul>  

<li> Establish a membership committee within the CEC to address council makeup, specifically the geographic, age, gender and racial composition of the council.</li>

<li> Re-establish County 4-H Expansion and Review Committee to examine the makeup of advisory committees, programming opportunities provided to extension audiences, and involvement in programs and recommend actions which will be implemented to bring about parity in leadership and program participation.</li>

<li> Program with Women’s Crisis Center and the Housing Authority to provide the Women’s Financial Management Program for limited resource and single parent clientele in October. (from POW)</li>

<li> One of the summer nutrition day camps will be held in the park located in the Hispanic Community</li>

<li> Expand Reality Store with a goal of conducting this program in all middle schools in Adams County.(from POW)</li>

<li> An after – school 4-H Club will be established at the community room in the limited resource neighborhood.</li>

<li> During the winter months, clothing construction classes will be offered to 4-H youth and non-4-H youth of community. Classes will be taught by trained volunteers and Master Clothing Volunteers with bus transportation provided by the schools to the training sites which will be determined by student signup.(from POW)</li>

<li> The Extension field day will continue to be rotated around the county with topics and themes identified by the field day committee. This year’s event will be scheduled in the evening (from 5:00-9:00 p.m.) as individuals reported they had not been able to attend due to work conflicts.  This year, 40 resource type agencies will set up booths making participants aware of the many services available in the county.(from POW)</li>

<strong>Affirmative Action Goals</strong>
This is the state of affairs county programs are working toward in terms of reaching all audiences.  These goals will come about as a result of examining the makeup of advisory committees, geographic, age, racial and gender participation in programs, and the variety of programming opportunities provided to extension audiences.  <strong>As you list your goals, include the initials of the agents responsible for setting that particular goal.</strong>
</p>
<p [innerHtml]="plan.goals"></p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>

<strong>Action Strategies to accomplish the above identified Affirmative Action Goals</strong>
Action strategies should be as specific as possible and should include those efforts the county staff intends to initiate during this program year.  Efforts will be related to strengthening councils and leadership, providing more diversity in these groups as well as actual programming and outreach efforts from the county Plan of Work.  <strong>As you list your efforts to achieve identified goals, include the initials of the agents responsible for carrying out each particular effort.</strong> 
</p>
<p [innerHtml]="plan.strategies"></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>III. STRATEGIES FOR PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION</strong></p>



<p>The following strategies will be used to ensure Extension programs reach a broad segment of the population of the county.</p>



<p><strong>Affirmative Action</strong></p>



<p>In programming, it should be a part of our day-to-day planning and delivery. It is the actions we take to ensure our programs are “serving all Kentuckians.” Affirmative actions or steps could include:

</p><ul>

<li> Evaluation of past participation in Extension programs and development of goals for reaching a more diverse audience.</li>

<li> Making sure advisory councils and planning committees are representative of the population of the county.</li>

<li> Holding meetings at various times and locations.</li>

<li> Utilizing assistance and advice of members of underrepresented groups.</li>

</ul>

<p></p>



<p><strong>Public Notification Plan</strong></p>



<p>All staff will follow public notification procedures to insure that the public is aware of Extension's nondiscriminatory position.  Staff must:</p>



<p>

</p><ol>

<li> Display the nondiscriminatory poster <strong><u>And Justice for All.</u></strong></li>

<li>All stationary, newsletters, and news articles must contain the nondiscriminatory statement: 

<strong>Educational programs of the Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service serve all people regardless of race, color, age, sex, religion, disability, or national origin.</strong></li>

<li>Promotional materials, photos, and other graphics will portray the diversity of Extension clientele.</li>

<li>Extension cannot conduct programs with any organization or group that excludes any person because of race, color, national origin, sex, age, religion, or disability.</li>

<li>All Extension-sponsored groups must sign a statement of nondiscrimination on an annual basis.</li>

</ol>

<p></p>



<p><strong>All Reasonable Efforts</strong></p>



<p>“All reasonable efforts” consist of a series of approaches that are required of Extension staff to solicit participation of the underrepresented group.  These are used in addition to affirmative action procedures, and are required when programs do not meet balanced participation requirements.  Some situations that call for "all reasonable efforts" include the following:  (a) an Extension sponsored or assisted group that does not reflect the racial composition of the target community, (b) advisory or decision-making groups that do not reflect the composition of the potential audience, and (c) program participation in which certain groups are consistently underrepresented.</p>



<p>It is the responsibility of each staff member to implement the steps necessary to attain the goal of balanced involvement in planning, membership, and participation.  Leaders in Extension-sponsored or assisted organizations must show good faith in regard to affirmative action to continue receiving Extension support.  Written records of letters, phone calls, and visits will be used as documentation that "all reasonable efforts" are being implemented.  A file of the documented efforts labeled “All Reasonable Efforts” will be kept in the office. The steps in "all reasonable efforts" must be repeated and documented until balanced participation is met and maintained.</p>



<p>Examples of “all reasonable efforts” may include:</p>

<p>

</p><ol>

<li>Use media outlets that target the underrepresented group to announce programs and events.</li>

<li>Develop announcements, flyers, and posters to be placed in locations frequented by the underrepresented group.</li>

<li>Write personal letters to and contact members of the underrepresented group to encouraging their participation.</li>

<li>Make personal contact with leaders from the underrepresented group to seek their assistance in encouraging participation.</li>

<li>Seek assistance from other community groups in encouraging participation.</li>

</ol>

<p></p>



<p><strong>Parity of Participation</strong></p>



<p>Parity of participation is reached when the percent distribution of participation by race and gender is proportionate to, or within reasonable limits of their respective percent distribution in the potential recipient audience/population This percent is a guide for us to evaluate our success in reaching a diverse audience and should be considered as a minimum goal.</p>



<p><strong>Documentation/Record Keeping</strong></p>



<p>

Access to the county Affirmative Action Plan, civil rights legislation, and policy directives will be available in each County Extension office.  The following records are required in each county to document Affirmative Action compliance:</p>



<ol>

<li>Membership of councils with race and gender designated</li>



<li>Program participation by race and gender

<dd>a.	Meeting rosters for public trainings and activities</dd>

<dd>b.	Summary contact data from CATPAWS</dd>

</li>



<li>Evidence that all mailings and news releases contain the nondiscrimination statement</li>



<li>Dated and signed statements from Extension sponsored clubs/groups acknowledging the leader's understanding that their membership is open to all (can be done as a group or individually).</li>



<li>Nondiscriminatory membership statement is present in all by-laws.</li>



<li>Evidence that newsletters include the procedure for filing a complaint at least annually.</li>



<li>A copy of mailing lists with race and gender designated</li>



</ol>



<p>

A complete checklist for Affirmative Action files is available on the Program and Staff Development website: 

http://www.ca.uky.edu/psd/Affirmative%20Action/Affirmative%20Action%20Documenation%20Checklist%202010.doc  

</p>

<p><strong>Procedure for Filing a Civil Rights Complaint</strong></p>
<p>Agents will make the public aware of the following complaint procedures:</p>
<p>Any employee who believes they have been discriminated against may seek resolution through a variety of paths. Discrimination may be reported to the District Director or supervisor. To initiate a complaint at the college level, contact Tim West in the Business Office at 859-257-3879. At the University level, Terry Allen and Patty Bender in the UK Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity (859-257-8927) may be contacted. Additionally, employee or clientele complaints involving any Research or Extension sponsored program or activity may be directed to the USDA, Director Office of Civil Rights, Room 326-W Whitten Bldg., 14th &amp; Independence Ave. SW, Washington, DC 20250-9410 (202-720-5964).</p>
<p>Agents will make the public aware of the complaint procedure by placing the following statement in their newsletters at least once per year.</p>
<p>
</p><table class="table"><tbody><tr><td>

To file a complaint of discrimination, contact Tim West, UK College of Agriculture, 
859-257-3879; Terry Allen or Patty Bender, UK Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity, 859-257-8927; or the USDA, Director Office of Civil Rights, Room 326-W Whitten Bldg., 14th &amp; Independence Ave. SW, Washington, DC 20250-9410 (202-720-5964). 
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Nondiscriminatory Membership Statement for Constitution and By-Laws</strong></p>



<p><strong>Include in all by-laws:</strong>  All members shall be selected and programs conducted without regard to race, color, age, sex, religion, disability, or national origin.</p>



<p><strong>Equal Employment Opportunity</strong></p>



<p>The Kentucky Cooperative Extension System is committed to providing equal employment opportunities on the basis of merit, qualifications and competence to all qualified individuals without regard to race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin or disability.  This applies to both professional and support staff.  Equal employment opportunities will be provided in all personnel matters.</p>



<p>County Extension Agents are responsible for assuring that nondiscriminatory hiring procedures are followed for county support positions and appropriate records are maintained.  Procedures are outlined in the County Extension Office Procedures Manual.  http://ces.ca.uky.edu/manual/node/51.  This process will be monitored by the District Director to assure nondiscrimination.	</p>



<p><strong>Compliance Reviews</strong></p>



<p>Monitoring of compliance with civil rights/affirmative action procedures is an on-going part of program planning and implementation.  Good program planning and implementation will include specific procedures for targeting special audiences, publicizing of education programs, involving underrepresented groups in identifying needs, selecting educational methods appropriate for the audience, and making special efforts to involve minorities in programs and activities.</p>



<ol>

<li>Performance Appraisal - Compliance with affirmative action goals will be annually determined for each staff member through uniform personnel appraisal procedures.  District Directors will be monitoring the progress toward achieving affirmative action expectations for the staff they supervise.  Continuous feedback and counseling are an integral part of this process.  Any deficiencies will be identified and corrected.</li>



<li>Annual Reports - Annual Reports will document progress made on program participation, group membership, and advisory group membership.  Progress toward affirmative action goals will be assessed.  These data will be reviewed and analyzed for each county and for the state as a whole.</li>



<li>County Program Reviews - Documentation of civil rights/affirmative action compliance will be examined in each county as a part of on-going county program reviews.  County plans, reports, and documentation files must be available for review.  These reviews will assess the county's progress in achieving balanced participation.  The review process includes recommendations from the review team for dealing with any deficiencies discovered and county follow-up procedures to insure corrective action has been taken.  Counties will be reviewed every five years by a review team made up of Extension administrators, specialist and agents.</li>

</ol>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>IV. THE LEGAL BASE</strong></p>



<p>The following sections of civil rights legislation are particularly relevant for Extension:</p>



<p><strong>Title VI</strong></p>



<p>Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that no person in the United States shall, on the basis of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal funding.  In other words, our programs are open to all.  Complying with Title VI requires the Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service develop and maintain a data base that identifies eligible populations and monitors the extent to whom programs and services are delivered. Various court rulings have held that merely certifying that a nondiscriminatory policy is in effect is insufficient.  Positive, affirmative steps must be taken to assure participation by minorities and women.</p>

<br>



<p><strong>Title VII</strong></p>



<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibit discrimination in employment due to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Equal opportunity must be an integral part of personnel policy and practice including

employment selection, training, advancement and treatment.  The law also makes it illegal to retaliate against a person because the person complained about discrimination, filed a charge of discrimination, or participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit. </p>

<br>



<p><strong>Title IX</strong></p>



<p>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination against students and employees in federally assisted education programs or activities.</p>

<br>



<p><strong>Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and ADA</strong></p>



<p>The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities.  The intention of both acts is to extend employment, services, and programs to citizens with disabilities.  This includes not only providing physical access for individuals with disabilities but also providing accommodations which would allow for full participation.  For Extension programs, this could include providing a sign language interpreter, materials in Braille, or an audio tape of written materials. A resource list for accommodating ADA request is available http://www.ca.uky.edu/psd/affirmative_action.php </p>

<br>



<p><strong>Age Discrimination</strong></p>



<p>A number of federal laws address age discrimination.  These include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; as amended; the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended; and sections of 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.</p>

	

<p>Collectively, these acts protect employees or program participants who are age 40 or older from age-based discrimination.</p>

<br>



<p><strong>Civil Rights Act of 1991</strong></p>



<p>This act allows women, religious minorities and the disabled to seek monetary damages in cases of intentional discrimination.  It also made provisions for attorney fees and trail by jury.</p>

<br>



<p><strong>Executive Order 13166<br>

Improving Access for Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency </strong></p>



<p>Under Title VI and federal agency regulations implementing Title VI, recipients of federal financial assistance have a responsibility to make reasonable steps to provide Limited English Proficiency (LEP) individuals with meaningful access to their programs and activities.  Established in 2000, Executive Order  13166  clarified the need of Federally assisted programs to provide services to LEP audiences. </p>

<br>



<p><strong>University Policy<br>

Discrimination and Harassment</strong></p>



<p>The University of Kentucky will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any student, faculty, staff or volunteer/clientele/visitor.  A copy of the policy on Discrimination and Harassment can be found at:  http://www.uky.edu/EVPFA/EEO/index.html </p>
