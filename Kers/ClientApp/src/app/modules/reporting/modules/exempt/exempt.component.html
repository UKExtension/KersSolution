<p>All Kentucky Cooperative Extension volunteer-led entities that handle money (have income and expenses) are to be listed below.</p>

<p>Note: Even if the funds of a club/group go through the county program council's bank account, the club/group should be listed here. In reality, the club is handling money-the club determines how the money is to be spent by preparing a budget. The council treasurer makes payments based on the club's budget.
